            <p class="first-p">I must focused on my mission 2022. I have already wasted 6 years by doing nothing. I
                didn't
                improve any
                skill. I just completed my BSc in Engineering but trust me I know nothing. In 2022 you won't get
                anything without skill. So I have to be skilled in some sectors. BTW 2022 is almost over. LOL. But it's
                never too late. It's better to start today then never.</p>

                        I know basic video editing. In case I am lucky enough that I am earning enough by this.
                        Everybody
                        knows my level editing. So in this year I have to be a pro editor. I need to learn some
                        softwares
                        like Photoshop, Premeire pro, Illustrator & After effect.

                        I already started this journey six months ago. But after trying some days, I stopped. Now I have
                        started again. I am doing Jhankar's Fullstack Web development course. I have finished 4 days
                        lesson in 15 days. And it's my first assignment of this course.

                        I have enrolled a new course of Jhankar. It's a course of fundamental computer engineering. Here
                        I should learn basic programming, algorithm, database etc. This course will be started from
                        28 September. But I will miss the begining of this course because I am going to India for
                        somedays.

            <h2>Stories of <br> Two-wheeler</h2>
            <p><i> I got my own bike on 26th of April, 2022. It's a beautiful thing. I just love it. In
                    future I will go
                    on
                    some long tours. For long tours I need some other bikers. I got Ashiq but I need atleast 3 more
                    bikers.
                    I love to ride it. When the gentle breeze touches me, it feels like nature is cuddling me. Bike's
                    speed
                    feels like it's runing in my blood. Thing is that bikes's accident rate is high in our country. Most
                    of
                    the people thinks it's not a safe ride. Most of the time it's not even our fault for accident. I
                    wish
                    someday our roads will be safe for all!</i></p>

            <h2>Little bit of a <br>Traveller</h2>
            <p><i>I like to travel. Thing is that who dosen't love to travel. I should learn earning money by traveling.
                    But I am lazy, so I just love it. I am not trying to have it. <br> I was lucky enough that I got
                    many
                    chances to explore many places. I have seen some raw beauties of our country. In our country Saint
                    Martin is my favourite place. I have been Cox's Bazar, Patuakhali, Sitakundo, Chittagong, Bandarban,
                    Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulovibazar, Narsingdi, Narayanganj Netrokona, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Natore,
                    Chapainawabganj, Naogaon, Joypurhat, Rangpur, Nilphamari, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur,
                    Thakurgaon,
                    Gajipur, Cumilla. I have visited India sometimes. There I have been Kolkata, Cherrapunji, Pynursula,
                    Dawki, Shilong, Shiliguri, Guwati, Kohima, Gangtok.</i></p>

                <p>Hey! I am Mehrab. I have completed my BSc in Engineering from Sylhet Engineering College in Computer
                    Science & Engineering. I love taking photos, playing valorant, travelling, bike riding and many
                    things. I love see things in order. So I spend my most of the times in placing things in order. I
                    like everything clean. So I clean my room a lot. I wash my cloths always. I clean my tables daily.
                    After doing these things I got tired. And I told it earlier that I am a lazy person. So I never make
                    any time for me to develop any skill. <br> I have some other addictions like facebook scrolling and
                    watching movies. I waste lots of time on watching youtube. Recently I developed another addiction,
                    it's palying valorant. I don't know how to deal with these things!
                    <br> I am too lazy to make myself worthy. I know nothing but I act like I know everything. If
                    someone has
                    zero knowledge, he can't act always. So it's high time to make myself a better person, make myself a
                    skilled person, make a worthy person.
